<h1 align="center">👋 Hey there! I'm Jewel Shahi</h1>

👋 Hello! I'm a highly skilled software developer with expertise in various programming languages and technologies. With 5 years of experience in ***Java***, I excel at building robust and scalable applications. 🌟 I also have 1-2 years of experience with ***JavaFX*** and ***JavaSwing***, which are widely used for desktop app development.

Additionally, I have spent 3 years learning and mastering ***C++***, a powerful language for system-level programming and performance optimization. 💪 Moreover, I have 1 year of experience in ***C#***, which allows me to create versatile applications using Microsoft's **.NET framework** and work with the most popular game engine - ***Unity***. I also have 1 year of experience in ***Java Spring Boot***, which is used for creating backends for websites.

As a **full-stack web developer**, I have spent 2-3 years honing my skills in ***HTML***, ***CSS***, and ***JavaScript***. I have also gained expertise in **JavaScript frameworks** like ***React.js*** and ***Next.js***, as well as **CSS framework** like ***TailwindCSS***. These tools are essential for crafting dynamic and interactive web pages. ⚡️ This knowledge empowers me to design visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

In addition to my expertise in various programming languages and technologies, I also have experience working with ***Arduino***. I have invested a significant amount of time in exploring the Arduino platform and developing projects using Arduino boards and the Arduino programming language.

For managing databases, I have knowledge in ***MySQL***, ***SQLite*** and ***MongoDB***. These are all popular and widely used database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
