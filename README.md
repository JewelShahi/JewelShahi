# Jewel Shahi

👋 Hey there! I'm Jewel Shahi, a highly skilled software developer with expertise in various programming languages and technologies. With 4 years of experience in Java, I excel at building robust and scalable applications. 🌟 I also have 1-2 years of experience with JavaFX and JavaSwing, which are widely used for desktop app development.

Additionally, I have spent 4 years mastering C++, a powerful language for system-level programming and performance optimization. 💪 Moreover, I have 1 year of experience in C#, which allows me to create versatile applications using Microsoft's .NET framework and work with a game engine - Unity. I also have 1 year of experience in JavaSpringBoot, which is used for creating backends for websites.

As a full-stack web developer, I have spent 2-3 years honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also gained expertise in JavaScript frameworks like React.js and Next.js, as well as CSS framework like TailwindCSS. These tools are essential for crafting dynamic and interactive web pages. ⚡️ This knowledge empowers me to design visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

In addition to my expertise in various programming languages and technologies, I also have experience working with Arduino. I have spent 4 months exploring the Arduino platform and developing projects using Arduino boards and the Arduino programming language.

For managing databases, I have knowledge in MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB. These are all popular and widely used database management systems, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
